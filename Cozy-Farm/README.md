# Chick Raiser

An idle game made in Unity where the player collects eggs laid by chickens on an island. Chickens move around the island, lay eggs, and the player can buy island extensions. The player can sell eggs for coins and hatch them to get more chickens. There's also a worker chicken that automatically collects eggs.
