# Tower Defense Game

## Overview

Welcome to my Tower Defense game, a project developed using Unity for the final project of this course. This README aims to document the design, development process, features, and complexities involved in creating this game. The game stands out not only for its engaging gameplay but also for the strategic depth and technical challenges it offers.

## Concept and Motivation

The idea of creating a Tower Defense game stemmed from my fascination with strategy games that require players to think critically and plan ahead. Unlike the other games implemented during the course, this project introduces a higher level of complexity by incorporating real-time strategy elements, resource management, and dynamic enemy behavior. The motivation behind this project was to create a game that is not only fun to play but also challenging to develop, pushing my skills in game design and programming.

## Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay

In the Tower Defense game, players must defend their base from waves of incoming enemies by strategically placing various types of towers along their path. Each tower has unique attributes such as range, damage, and rate of fire. Players earn resources by defeating enemies, which can be used to upgrade existing towers or build new ones. The objective is to survive as many waves as possible without letting enemies breach the base.

### Features

- **Multiple Tower Types**: The game includes different types of towers, each with distinct abilities and upgrade paths.
- **Variety of Enemies**: Enemies vary in speed, health, and special abilities, requiring players to adapt their strategies.
- **Upgrading System**: Towers can be upgraded to improve their effectiveness, adding a layer of strategic depth.
- **Dynamic Pathfinding**: Enemies use A\* pathfinding to navigate the map, making their movement unpredictable and challenging to counter.
- **Resource Management**: Players must manage their resources efficiently to build and upgrade towers.

## Development Process

### Design and Planning

The project began with a detailed design phase, where I outlined the core mechanics, game flow, and user interface. I created mockups and flowcharts to visualize the game’s structure and mechanics. This planning phase was crucial to ensure a clear development roadmap and to manage the project’s complexity.

### Implementation

The implementation phase involved several key stages:

- **Setting Up Unity**: I created the game environment using Unity, setting up the terrain, paths, and base locations.
- **Creating Towers and Enemies**: I designed and programmed various tower and enemy types, implementing their behaviors and interactions.
- **Pathfinding**: Implementing A\* pathfinding for enemy movement was one of the most challenging aspects, requiring a deep understanding of algorithms and optimization techniques.
- **User Interface**: I designed a user-friendly interface for building and upgrading towers, as well as displaying game stats and resources.
- **Balancing and Testing**: Ensuring the game is balanced and fun to play involved extensive testing and tweaking of game mechanics.

## Complexity and Distinctiveness

This Tower Defense game meets and exceeds the complexity requirements of the course projects due to several factors:

- **Strategic Depth**: The game requires players to think strategically about tower placement and resource management.
- **Dynamic Behavior**: The use of A\* pathfinding for enemy movement adds a level of unpredictability and challenge not present in simpler games.
- **Advanced Programming**: Implementing features like tower upgrades, multiple enemy types, and dynamic resource management required advanced programming skills and a thorough understanding of game development principles.
- **Comprehensive User Interface**: The user interface is designed to be intuitive yet comprehensive, providing players with all the necessary information and controls.

## Conclusion

Developing this Tower Defense game was a rewarding experience that allowed me to apply and expand upon the skills learned throughout the course. The project’s complexity, strategic depth, and technical challenges distinguish it from other course projects, making it a suitable candidate for the final project. I am proud of the final product and confident in its ability to provide an engaging and challenging gameplay experience.

Thank you for taking the time to review my project. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it!
